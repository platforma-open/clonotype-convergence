## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 8424b69: Cache the compute-neighbours (Stage 1) result with a 24h TTL. Stage 1 is the
  expensive, threshold-independent STAR neighbour computation; without a cache
  hint its intermediate output was reference-counted away once Stage 2 consumed
  it, so changing only the threshold re-ran the whole pipeline. With the TTL, a
  threshold change recovers Stage 1 from cache and recomputes only the cheap
  downstream stages (observed: ~1h → ~10min on a real project).
- 85090fc: Encode the block's settings (threshold(s), nMin when non-default, cluster
  filter) into the column trace label so downstream blocks (graph-maker,
  data-mapping) can tell apart columns from multiple convergence blocks on the
  same dataset — previously they collapsed to identical labels. The page
  subtitle and the trace label now derive from one shared builder
  (getDefaultBlockLabel): the subtitle prefixes the dataset, the trace omits it
  (the dataset is already in the column domain). A user-set block label still
  overrides both.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c318d11: Initial release — fast-STAR clonotype convergence detection for BCR repertoires.

  Wraps statbiophys/STAR's neighbour-count algorithm to flag clonotypes under
  convergent selection. Accepts any BCR-compatible MiXCR anchor: bulk heavy,
  bulk light, or single-cell IG (with an explicit "Process light chain"
  opt-in for SC paired data).

  Pipeline runs as three pure-template stages — compute-neighbours
  (threshold-independent, expensive), apply-threshold (Hit / Not hit
  categorical), and an optional cluster filter (paper's binder definition,
  Hamming/Levenshtein-1 single-linkage). Outputs a per-(sample, clonotype)
  table with a sample picker above it, two per-chain neighbour-frequency
  histograms with a configurable threshold line, and a centered hit-statistics
  modal in the main-page header.
